# Human-following-robot-using-raspberry-pi
Robot detects presence of a person in camera frame using a Machine Learning model 'MobileNet SSD v1 (COCO)' and TensorFlow Lite interpreter. The code of Human following robot is partially derived from the Object Tracking code. However, there is a difference in the method which calculates distance from the object to generate forward motion command.
